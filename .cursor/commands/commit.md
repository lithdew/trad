# commit

Look at all staged changes. Create a Github-ready conventional commit with a title and description. The title must be prefixed with either feat/refactor/chore/test. The description must be a paragraph or two describing the impact of the changes. Github-ready means that character limits per line in the commit title/description are respected. Every line must be well under 72 characters.
